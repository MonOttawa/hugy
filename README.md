## Introduction

Hugy is a desktop (Electron) app aimed at content editors onboarding projects using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site genertor. 
Static sites are great and Hugo is a great static site generator but due to its specifity (a command line tool) it may be hard
to ask copywriters to use it in projects.
